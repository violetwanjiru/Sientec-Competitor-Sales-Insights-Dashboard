## The goal of this project was to perform competitor sales analysis
Founded in 2018, Sientec is a manufacturing company competing in the highly dynamic global marketing landscape. The company operates across multiple product categories and sells in markets including the United States, Germany, and other international regions. To better understand its position against top competitors, Sientec has built a comprehensive competitor sales repository that tracks key performance metrics, including revenue, units sold, market share, and revenue per unit.

With a focus on strategic growth, Sientec’s goals are twofold: 1) to identify opportunities to close revenue gaps with premium-priced competitors, and 2) to strengthen its presence in underrepresented markets while leveraging strong sales volumes in core regions.

# Dataset Structure
The dataset consisted of five tables, including information about Sales details, product details and Location details.

# Insights Summary 

To evaluate competitive positioning and market performance, we focused on the following key metrics:
- Revenue Growth – Year-over-year revenue change to measure momentum.
- Units Sold – Volume performance to assess market penetration.
- Revenue per Unit (RPU) – Pricing power and product value indicator.
- Market Share – Share of total revenue and units sold in the competitive set.
#### Year-over-Year Revenue Growth
- Sientec achieved a 65.70% YoY revenue increase, rising from $43.23M to $71.23M.
- This growth rate outpaces the industry competitor average of 54.90%, signalling stronger momentum in market demand.
- The above-average growth positions Sientec as a leading performer within its competitive landscape.
#### High Unit Sales Volume
- Sientec sold 200K units, which is 49% more than its closest competitor, despite generating lower total revenue.
- This discrepancy indicates Sientec’s products are likely positioned at a more affordable price point, driving higher sales volumes.
- The high unit volume suggests strong market penetration, even if per-unit revenue trails premium-priced competitors.

#### Revenue per Unit (RPU)
- Sientec generates an average of ~$356 per unit, outperforming Aquatal’s ~$283 but falling significantly behind Artisans’ ~$825, 
  which is more than double Sientec’s RPU.
- Artisans’ high revenue per unit reflects a strong premium pricing strategy and likely higher perceived brand value,
   enabling them to achieve superior revenue with lower sales volume.

#### Market Share
  - Sientec holds a solid 19% revenue market share, supported by its position as the volume leader, yet trails Artisans in overall revenue performance.
  - Artisans dominate the market with a 30% share despite selling fewer units, reflecting strong brand influence and a premium pricing strategy.
  - Closing the gap will require Sientec to capture high-value customers from Artisans or expand into new, higher-margin market niches.
  - Sientec maintains a dominant 38% market share in the USA, establishing it as our core stronghold. However, in all other regions,
    Our presence is significantly weaker, with Germany showing the smallest market share among them.

#### Segment & Category Focus
- Artisans derive 100% of their revenue from the Urban category ($110.6M), with the Moderation sub-segment alone contributing $55.6M.
- Their leading product, the Maximus UM-80, generates approximately $12M in revenue, underscoring strong dominance within this niche.
- Sientec remains under-indexed in the Urban–Moderation submarket but holds clear potential to capture share through targeted product
   development and competitive positioning in this high-value segment.

  # Implications
- Sientec’s growth trajectory is strong, but pricing, product mix, and geographic diversification are critical to closingthe revenue gap with premium   competitors.
- Competitors’ top products dominate brand influence, requiring targeted innovation to improve Sientec’s market visibility.

  # Recommended Actions
  - Launch Premium Product Lines to increase RPU while retaining high-volume advantage.
  - Penetrate Urban–Moderation Segment to compete directly with Artisans’ top revenue driver (Maximus UM-80).
  - Expand into Underrepresented Regions such as Germany to reduce geographic concentration risk.
  - Enhance Brand Perception through targeted marketing and product innovation in top-tier categories.
